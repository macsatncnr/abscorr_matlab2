The program calculates the neutron and x-ray transmission corrections for arbitrary shape samples. It is a generalized version of the Wuensch and Prewitt algorithm [1]. This new version supports complex shapes, closed geometries like spheroids intersected by several surfaces and arrays of multiple samples.

The sample boundaries  must be defined as quadratic surfaces of the form 

F= Ax^2 + By^2 + Cz^2+ Dxy + Eyz + Gzx +Hx +Iy +Jz.

Eg.  A cyiinder with a radius r and length l can be defined with three surfaces:

x^2+y^2=r^2  		A=1 B=1 F=r^2
 z=l/2   			J=1  F=1/2
z=-l/2  			J=2  F=-l/2
